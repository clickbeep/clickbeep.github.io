<h1>Changelog</h1>
<h3>Please don't mind my sense of humor. I'm just here to have fun.</h3>
<p>How do you make it so a link isn't blue?  Maybe I dont't want to shout out that something is a link.  Maybe the link is tired of being blue.  And having a blue house, and a blue Corvette.  Maybe that link is tired of everything being blue for him and himself, because that link doesn't have anyone to listen.</p>
<p>All the titles are now the same header style.  Hooray for consistancy!</p>
<p>I should write a proper About page instead of this.</p>
<p>Made bookmark icons for Chrome.  They don't work.</p>
<p>El Goog didn't like my website.  Wasn't fleshed out enough yet.  =/</p>
<p>Submitted the website to Google to /possibly/ have advertisements.</p>
<p>I can't seem to use an ampersand in my text.  Bummer.</p>
<p>Got rid of the LINK placeholders.  They just got in my way.</p>
<p>Why can't I use two spaces between a period and the start of the next sentance in HTML?  I get that the kids these days only use one space between a period and the start of their next sentance, but I'm an old man and stuck in my ways.</p>
<p>The clown shoes now get bigger when the window gets bigger.<br>That's what she said.  Bow chicka bow wow.</p>
<p>Changed Blank Link to Link, because it was too wide for the mobile version.</p>
<p>Pretty sure the whole site is under 50KB.  Aside from the clown shoes.</p>
<p>I made a changelog!  Keep track of my progress friends, for I will spam you all incessently with links and convoluted texts about my updates.
<p>Do changelogs read from top to bottom?</p>
<p>I should use (p) instead of a bunch of (br) for line breaks.  I should I should.</p>
<p>Added www to the CNAME (seriously, it was bugging me).</p>
<p>Padding on the text.</p>
<p>Although seriously, who is going to be looking at this site with a device that's not 410 pixels wide?</p>
<p>Figured out how to edit the @Media Screen section, so I can have separate padding for the nav bar when it's viewed on a computer, vs when it's viewed on a mobile.</p>
<p>It looks good on mobile!</p>
<p>Persistant nav bar breaks the rectangle used for the nav bar.  Or, the about link goes off the page.  I don't want a persistant nav bar that bad.</p>
<p>Finally made my own nav bar!  It resizes with the browser, and changes style when browser width is less than 410 pixels.</p>
<p>Spent a headache inducingly epic amount of time fiddling around with the nav bar from Apple's website, trying to see if I could steal some of their design.<br>I couldn't.</p>
<p>Something something something something clown shoes.</p>
<a href="http://www.clickbeep.net/tylerlikesfiveguysatatime" style="text-decoration: none; color: #000000;">Trolled Tyler.</a>
<p>Icon for saving to the home page of iOS devices.  We'll see about Android later.</p>
<p>Metadata for Safari/Mobile Safari!</p>
<p>Had to find a telephone=no flag so that Mobile Safari would stop trying to turn my 0s and 1s into phone numbers.</p>
<p>Made the nerdiest 404 page ever.</p>
<p>Finally figured out how to point the page to my domain.  That part should not have taken nearly as long as it did.</p>
