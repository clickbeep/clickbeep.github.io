<h1>Handbook<br></h1>
<h1>Click Beep</h1>
<p>Click Beep will begin as an LLC fully owned by William Larson.</p>
<h2>Contributors/Employees</h2>
<p>Currently, Click Beep does not plan on having hourly or salaried employees.  As content is created, contributors will be paid as the business receives money.  This will probably be after the YouTube channel crosses 10,000 views, and can be monetized. No payments will be made until after the company has paid for it's startup costs and it's first purchase.</p>
<h2>Startup Costs</h2>
Legal Zoom filing, Trademark filing, website registration.
<h2>First Purchase</h2>
Ideally, Click Beep's first purchase will be a computer system capable of 4K video editing, video editing software, a quality camera for video capture.
Camera in mind - Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera ($995)
<h2>Other Costs</h2>
Paid for by the owner will be three iCloud Drive Accounts (Jim, Rachel, Company), one Apple Music subscription, one Adobe Photography Plan (Lightroom + Photoshop), one internet plan, two cell phones on Verizon, and one Xbox Live account.
<h2>Equipment</h2>
Equipment purchased by the company will be owned by the company.  Equipment owned by the company is available, and can be checked out by contributors and employees for personal projects or work related projects.<br><br><br>
<h1>Videos</h1>
<h2>Uploading</h2>
One of Click Beep's expenses will be internet.  So we don't burn through anyone's internet cap, video uploads will be performed on Click Beep's internet connection.<br><br>
<h2>Video Payouts</h2>
When the channel hits 10,000 views, videos will begin to generate money.  Contributors will earn money based on their role in creating the video, as it earns money.  Payments will be monthly, after YouTube commits final numbers for the previous month.  Monthly video profits will be split to the contributors in the following manner:<br><br>
<b><u>40% - Footage/Performance</u></b><br>Based on the type of video.<br>Example, game review: If person one captures game footage, and person two acts in from of the camera, screen time being equal, each person receives 20%.<br>Example, game footage: Person one records five minutes of game footage for a video, they receive all 40%.<br>
<b><u>25% - Click Beep</u></b><br>The business has to make money, money goes to buy equipment for better videos, items to review, games, tickets to E3, etc.<br>
<b><u>15% - Editing</u></b><br>Whoever does the majority of video edits.<br>
<b><u>10% - Idea</u></b><br>Original concept for a video.<br>
<b><u>5% - Equipment</u></b><br>Whoever owns the majority of the equipment used to create the footage - cameras, console, desktop, set, etc.<br>
<b><u>5% - Script</u></b><br>If there is no script, this goes to the editor.<br>
<b>= 100%</b><br><br>
Videos will not be uploaded unless all parties are in agreement on the breakout of the responsibilities.<br><br>
Individuals may choose to waive their contributions.  Example - Person one creates the concept, scripts the video, creates game footage, uses their equipment to record game footage, person two edits the video and takes credit for video editing, but does not wish to recieve 2.5% of equipment for using their computer to edit the video.<br><br>
<h2>Written Reviews</h2>
<b>25% - Click Beep</b><br>The business has to make money, money goes to buy equipment for better videos, items to review, games, tickets to E3, etc.<br>
<b>65% - Writer</b><br>Whoever writes the article gets this.<br>
<b>10% - Proof/Edit</b><br>Final grammar check and proof read.<br>
